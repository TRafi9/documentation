# 👋 Hey there, I'm Talha!

I'm a data engineer and full stack developer. I enjoy working with Python, Go (especially Go...), Docker, and those GCP Data engineering tools.

## 🚀 What I'm All About

### Data Engineering

Working in GCP I create and containerise ETL logic in both Python and Go and launch them using DAGs on airflow with configuration to point to data sources/sinks.

### Full Stack Development

I also work on both the frontend & backend of different applications (although I'm more keen on backend dev), using Python/Go/NextJs and a touch of Kubernetes.

## 📚 What's This Website For?

This website is my little corner of the internet where I share all the things I've learned and built. It's like a digital scrapbook, but instead of embarrassing childhood photos, it's filled with code snippets and project demos! 😄

Here's what you'll find:

- **Tutorials & Guides** 📝: I share step-by-step guides on how to do some pretty neat stuff with data engineering, full stack development, and all the tech I work with. It's like having a cheat sheet for my coding problems!

- **Projects** 🛠️: I showcase the projects I've poured my heart and soul into. From the technologies I used to the challenges I faced, I spill all the juicy details. It's like a behind-the-scenes look at my coding journey!

- **Blog** 🤔: This is where I let my thoughts run wild! I write about my experiences, lessons learned, and programming.

## 🤙 Let's Connect!
