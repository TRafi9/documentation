# Why I chose to make it (Learning)

Long story short I needed a project to help build my technical skills.

I chose this project as it would help me learn and develop my skills in things such as **Golang, kubernetes and API's**, but turns out it helped me develop a lot more than that, you can find the deep details in the **Skills used in Project** section!
