# Benefits of .NET

.NET is a framework that supports multiple programming languages, such as C#, F#, and VB.NET. C# and F# are the primary languages used for ASP.NET Core.

## 1. Multi-Language Support

.NET leverages the **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**, which allows programming languages to be compiled down to a common format. This enables multiple programming languages to be used within the same assembly since they are all compiled into the CIL.

## 2. Comprehensive Base Library

.NET includes a comprehensive **base class library** that provides predefined types and components for building libraries and enterprise-level websites. One example is the **BaseController class**, which provides a ready-made controller class with its associated methods, reducing development time.

## 3. JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time Compilation)

.NET uses a **JIT compiler** (Just-In-Time compiler), also referred to as the **Jitter** in some contexts. The JIT compiler varies depending on the infrastructure it's running on. It compiles code optimally based on the system's resources:

- On a large server, it may leverage abundant memory.
- On smaller devices like iOS, it may optimize for lower memory usage and improved performance.

## 4. Strong Support Cycle

.NET has a robust **support cycle** from Microsoft, with **Long-Term Support (LTS)** releases. LTS versions are supported for:

- 3 years after the initial release.
- 1 year of maintenance support after the subsequent LTS release.

This ensures that businesses and developers can rely on stable and secure releases for extended periods.

## 5. Common Type System and Common Language Specification

.NET uses a **Common Type System (CTS)** and **Common Language Specification (CLS)** to ensure compatibility across languages.

- **Common Type System (CTS)** defines the types that .NET can support, but not all languages may support all types within this system.
- **Common Language Specification (CLS)** specifies which types within the CTS are supported by all .NET languages. 

If your application restricts itself to using only the types defined by the CLS, your code will be compatible and can be compiled into CIL even when integrating multiple languages. This provides seamless integration and ensures cross-language compatibility in .NET applications.

## 6. Managed vs Unmanaged Code

Code created in C# that is **CLS-compliant** and targets the .NET framework is referred to as **managed code**. Managed code has several benefits:

- It can run on the .NET framework.
- It is platform-agnostic: code can be created on one operating system (e.g., Windows) and deployed on another (e.g., iOS) seamlessly.

If the code does not comply with the CLS and therefore does not target the .NET framework, it is known as **unmanaged code**. Although unmanaged code can still be accessed and executed, it is locked to a specific development and deployment environment, making it less flexible compared to managed code.
