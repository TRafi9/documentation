# Benefits of .NET

.NET is a framework that supports multiple programming languages, such as C#, F#, and VB.NET. C# and F# are the primary languages used for ASP.NET Core.

## 1. Multi-Language Support

.NET leverages the **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**, which allows programming languages to be compiled down to a common format. This enables multiple programming languages to be used within the same assembly since they are all compiled into the CIL.

## 2. Comprehensive Base Library

.NET includes a comprehensive **base class library** that provides predefined types and components for building libraries and enterprise-level websites. One example is the **BaseController class**, which provides a ready-made controller class with its associated methods, reducing development time.

## 3. JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time Compilation)

.NET uses a **JIT compiler** (Just-In-Time compiler), also referred to as the **Jitter** in some contexts. The JIT compiler varies depending on the infrastructure it's running on. It compiles code optimally based on the system's resources:

- On a large server, it may leverage abundant memory.
- On smaller devices like iOS, it may optimize for lower memory usage and improved performance.

## 4. Strong Support Cycle

.NET has a robust **support cycle** from Microsoft, with **Long-Term Support (LTS)** releases. LTS versions are supported for:

- 3 years after the initial release.
- 1 year of maintenance support after the subsequent LTS release.

This ensures that businesses and developers can rely on stable and secure releases for extended periods.
